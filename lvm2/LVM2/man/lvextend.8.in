.SH DESCRIPTION
lvextend allows you to extend the size of a logical volume.
Extension of snapshot logical volumes (see
.B lvcreate(8)
for information to create snapshots) is supported as well.
But to change the number of copies in a mirrored logical
volume use 
.BR lvconvert (8).
.SH OPTIONS
See \fBlvm\fP for common options.
.TP
.I \-\-noudevsync
Disable udev synchronisation. The
process will not wait for notification from udev.
It will continue irrespective of any possible udev processing
in the background.  You should only use this if udev is not running
or has rules that ignore the devices LVM2 creates.
.TP
.I \-l, \-\-extents [+]LogicalExtentsNumber[%{VG|LV|PVS|FREE|ORIGIN}]
Extend or set the logical volume size in units of logical extents.
With the + sign the value is added to the actual size
of the logical volume and without it, the value is taken as an absolute one.
The number can also be expressed as a percentage of the total space
in the Volume Group with the suffix %VG, relative to the existing
size of the Logical Volume with the suffix %LV, of the remaining
free space for the specified PhysicalVolume(s) with the suffix %PVS,
as a percentage of the remaining free space in the Volume Group
with the suffix %FREE, or (for a snapshot) as a percentage of the total
space in the Origin Logical Volume with the suffix %ORIGIN.
.TP
.I \-L, \-\-size [+]LogicalVolumeSize[bBsSkKmMgGtTpPeE]
Extend or set the logical volume size in units of megabytes.
A size suffix of M for megabytes,
G for gigabytes, T for terabytes, P for petabytes 
or E for exabytes is optional.
With the + sign the value is added to the actual size
of the logical volume and without it, the value is taken as an absolute one.
.TP
.I \-i, \-\-stripes Stripes
Gives the number of stripes for the extension.
Not applicable to LVs using the original metadata LVM format, which must
use a single value throughout.
.TP
.I \-I, \-\-stripesize StripeSize
Gives the number of kilobytes for the granularity of the stripes.
Not applicable to LVs using the original metadata LVM format, which must
use a single value throughout.
.br
StripeSize must be 2^n (n = 2 to 9)
.TP
.I \-f, \-\-force
Proceed with size extension without prompting.
.TP
.I \-n, \-\-nofsck
Do not perform fsck before extending filesystem when filesystem
requires it. You may need to use \fB--force\fR to proceed with 
this option.
.TP
.I \-r, \-\-resizefs
Resize underlying filesystem together with the logical volume using 
\fBfsadm\fR(8).
.SH Examples
"lvextend -L +54 /dev/vg01/lvol10 /dev/sdk3" tries to extend the size of
that logical volume by 54MB on physical volume /dev/sdk3.
This is only possible if /dev/sdk3 is a member of volume group vg01 and
there are enough free physical extents in it.

"lvextend /dev/vg01/lvol01 /dev/sdk3" tries to extend the size of that
logical volume by the amount of free space on physical volume /dev/sdk3.
This is equivalent to specifying "-l +100%PVS" on the command line.

.br
"lvextend -L+16M vg01/lvol01 /dev/sda:8-9 /dev/sdb:8-9"
.br
tries to extend a logical volume "vg01/lvol01" by 16MB using physical extents
/dev/sda:8-9 and /dev/sdb:8-9 for allocation of extents.
