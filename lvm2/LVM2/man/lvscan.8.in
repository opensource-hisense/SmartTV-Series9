.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lvscan
scans all known volume groups or all supported LVM block devices
in the system for defined Logical Volumes.  The output consists
of one line for each Logical Volume indicating whether or not it is active, 
a snapshot or origin, the size of the device and its allocation policy.
Use \fBlvs(8)\fP or \fBlvdisplay(8)\fP to obtain more-comprehensive information 
about the Logical Volumes.
.SH OPTIONS
See \fBlvm\fP for common options.
.TP
.BR \-\-all
Include information in the output about internal Logical Volumes that
are components of normally-accessible Logical Volumes, such as mirrors,
but which are not independently accessible (e.g. not mountable).
For example, after creating a mirror using 'lvcreate -m1 --mirrorlog disk',
this option will reveal three internal Logical Volumes, with suffixes
mimage_0, mimage_1, and mlog.

.BR \-b ", " \-\-blockdevice
This option is now ignored.  Instead, use \fBlvs(8)\fP or \fBlvdisplay(8)\fP to obtain
the device number.
