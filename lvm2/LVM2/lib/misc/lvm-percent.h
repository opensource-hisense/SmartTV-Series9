/*
 * A fixed-point representation of percent values. One percent equals to
 * PERCENT_1 as defined below. Values that are not multiples of PERCENT_1
 * represent fractions, with precision of 1/1000000 of a percent. See
 * percent_to_float for a conversion to a floating-point representation.
 *
 * You should always use make_percent when building percent_t values. The
 * implementation of make_percent is biased towards the middle: it ensures that
 * the result is PERCENT_0 or PERCENT_100 if and only if this is the actual
 * value -- it never rounds any intermediate value (> 0 or < 100) to either 0
 * or 100.
