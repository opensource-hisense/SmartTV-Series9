procmem_linux_x86_port
======================

procmem is available in android (Source: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/extras/+/master/procmem/). I derived the source code from Android and &amp; ported to Ubuntu Linux. Except the Makefile, rest of the files are almost same. Hope it helps.
