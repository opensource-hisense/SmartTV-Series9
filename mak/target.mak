# Description:
#         Compiler tool parameters to be included in the make process.
#
#         Note: this file provide the default compile, loader, utility
#         commands and their options for the default developer environment
#         (Linux/GNUWIN).
#
#         For a specific TRAGET build, the TARGET directory needs to
#         provide a target specific target.mak which specifies the
#         compiling tools for that target.
